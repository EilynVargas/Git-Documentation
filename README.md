# Git-Documentation
This is a technical documentation page developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp projects. For this documentation page I used git as inspiration. All the information was taken from Microsoft and Git websites, and this project is for practice purposes only.

If you want to see the finished site, visit this link: https://eilynvargas.github.io/Git-Documentation/
